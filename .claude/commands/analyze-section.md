# Electrical System Analysis

Analyze the Jeep LJ dual battery electrical system documentation as a senior electrical engineer specializing in low-voltage DC power systems for automotive and off-road applications.

## Argument Validation

**Section to analyze:** `$ARGUMENTS`

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or not provided:
1. List available sections in `docs/jeep_lj/`
2. Ask the user which section to analyze
3. Do not proceed until a valid section is specified

If the path doesn't exist, report the error and list valid sections.

## Task Overview

1. **Context gathering** - If analyzing any section other than `01-power-systems`, first read these files for system context:
   - `docs/jeep_lj/01-power-systems/index.md`
   - `docs/jeep_lj/01-power-systems/01-architecture/index.md`
   - `docs/jeep_lj/01-power-systems/04-pmu/01-output-configuration.md`

2. **Section analysis** - Review every `.md` file in `docs/jeep_lj/$ARGUMENTS/`

3. **Cross-references** - Follow links to other sections only when:
   - A specification references another component (verify compatibility)
   - A wire run connects to components in another section
   - Limit cross-reference depth to 1 level (don't follow links from linked files)

## Specialized Roles

Deploy these specialized subagents for focused analysis. Run in parallel where possible.

### Wire Specialist

**Trigger:** Any section with wiring tables or circuit specifications

**Focus:**
- Verify wire gauge calculations for every circuit (load × distance × derating)
- Calculate voltage drop and compare against thresholds
- Check temperature derating is applied correctly for wire location
- Verify wire ampacity exceeds protected circuit rating
- Flag any gauge specified without supporting calculation

**SAE J1128 Reference Data:**
| AWG | Ampacity @30°C | Ampacity @80°C (engine bay) |
|-----|----------------|------------------------------|
| 18  | 16A            | 10A                          |
| 16  | 22A            | 14A                          |
| 14  | 32A            | 20A                          |
| 12  | 41A            | 26A                          |
| 10  | 55A            | 35A                          |
| 8   | 73A            | 46A                          |
| 6   | 101A           | 64A                          |
| 4   | 135A           | 85A                          |
| 2   | 181A           | 114A                         |

**Output:** List of circuits with pass/fail status and calculations shown for any failures.

---

### Integration Checker

**Trigger:** Any section that references components in other sections

**Focus:**
- Cross-check voltage ranges between connected components
- Verify charging profiles match battery chemistry (LiFePO4 vs AGM vs lead-acid)
- Validate PMU output ratings against actual connected loads
- Check CAN bus device addresses for conflicts
- Verify ground reference compatibility between systems
- Confirm fuse/breaker ratings coordinate (upstream clears before downstream)

**Required Cross-References:**
- Battery specs → charger profiles
- PMU outputs → load requirements
- Alternator output → charge controller input limits
- Solar controller → battery charging parameters

**Output:** Compatibility matrix showing verified connections and any conflicts found.

---

### Environmental Reviewer

**Trigger:** All sections (off-road durability is always relevant)

**Focus:**
- Verify IP ratings for connection locations (IP67+ for exposed areas)
- Check wire routing avoids heat sources (exhaust, headers) with adequate clearance
- Confirm securing intervals in high-vibration zones (12-18" max)
- Validate physical protection (loom, conduit, grommets) for abrasion-prone routes
- Assess serviceability - can connections be accessed for trail repairs?
- Check thermal environment matches derating applied

**Location Categories:**
| Location | IP Required | Temp Derating | Vibration Level |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Engine bay | IP67 | 60-80°C | High |
| Wheel wells | IP67 | 20-50°C | Extreme |
| Under vehicle | IP67 | 40°C | High |
| Cabin/dash | IP40 | 40°C | Low |
| Trunk/cargo | IP40 | 40°C | Medium |

**Output:** Location-by-location assessment with pass/fail for each environmental factor.

## Subagent Coordination

**When to deploy specialists:**
- **Always run Environmental Reviewer** - applies to every section
- **Run Wire Specialist** when section contains wiring tables or circuit specs
- **Run Integration Checker** when section references external components

**Parallel execution:** Launch all applicable specialists simultaneously. Each returns findings in standard severity format.

**Consolidation:** Main analysis aggregates specialist findings, deduplicates, and assigns final severity ratings.

Each subagent should return findings in the standard severity format (see Issue Severity below).

## Evaluation Standards

**Primary Standards:**
- **SAE J1128:** Wire sizing, voltage drop limits, temperature derating
- **Off-Road Best Practices:** Wire protection, vibration resistance, water ingress prevention

**Reference Standards (apply selectively):**
- **ABYC E-11:** Dual battery systems, grounding architecture only
- **NEC Article 625:** Where automotive standards don't specify

**Quantified Requirements:**

| Parameter | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Voltage drop (critical loads) | < 3% |
| Voltage drop (accessories) | < 10% |
| Fuse/CB sizing | 125-160% of max continuous load |
| Wire securing interval | Every 12-18 inches in high-vibration areas |
| Water exposure connections | IP67 minimum |
| Engine bay temperature derating | 60-80°C |
| Cabin temperature derating | 40°C |
| Wheel well temperature derating | 20-50°C |
