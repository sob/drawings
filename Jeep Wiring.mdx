- **Rear Battery:** Handles all convenience loads (lights, radios, compressor, heated seats) - can be fully depleted without affecting starting ability
- **Weight Distribution:** Rear battery helps balance heavy Cummins diesel up front
- **Emergency Jump:** BCDC Alpha 50's jump start assist mode can parallel batteries if front battery fails
- **Charging Performance:** 50A output fully charges rear battery in ~1.5 hours from 50% depth of discharge
- **Redundancy:** Vehicle can limp home on front battery alone if rear system fails

### Alternator

- **Rating:** 200A (TBD - specific part number)
- **Output to Battery Positive:** 2/0 AWG cable (red)
- **Alternator Case Ground:** TBD - size and routing to engine block

### Grounding Architecture

- **Front Battery Negative to Chassis:** 2/0 AWG cable (black) - engine bay chassis point
- **Rear Battery Negative to Frame:** 2/0 AWG cable (black) - rear frame rail near wheel well
- **Front to Rear Ground Reference:** 2/0 AWG cable from front battery negative to rear battery negative
  - Prevents voltage differential between batteries
  - Critical for BCDC operation and system stability
- **Engine Block to Chassis:** 2/0 AWG cable
- **Auxiliary Ground Points:**

#### Fuel Pump Circuit

**ECM-Controlled (No External Power Circuit Required):**

The Cummins R2.8 uses an electronically controlled Common Rail fuel injection system with a high-pressure fuel pump mounted on the front of the engine and driven by the camshaft through a gear. The fuel pump is powered and controlled directly by the ECM (Engine Control Module) through the engine wiring harness provided by Cummins.

**No additional external power circuit, relay, or fuse is required** - the fuel pump receives power through the ECM's internal drivers and the Cummins-supplied engine harness.

**What this means for the electrical system:**
- The ECM (powered by Engine RTMR F5 - 20A) controls the fuel pump internally
- No separate fuel pump relay needed in the Engine RTMR
- No additional wiring required beyond the Cummins-supplied engine harness
- Fuel pump operation is automatic when ECM is powered and engine is cranking/running

### Communication Systems

#### Radio Head Unit

**System Overview:**
The dash-mounted radio head unit provides AM/FM radio, Bluetooth connectivity, and NMEA 2000 integration for marine-grade performance in off-road conditions.

**Components:**
- **Radio Head Unit:** Fusion MS-RA670 Marine Entertainment System
  - **Manual:** [Fusion MS-RA670 Installation Manual](https://pdf.crutchfieldonline.com/ImageBank/v20190610170100/Manuals/917/917RA670.PDF)
  - **Location:** Dashboard center console (factory radio location)
  - **Power Requirements:**
    - **Constant Power (Memory):** Yellow wire - 12V constant (battery direct)
    - **Switched Power (Ignition):** Red wire - 12V switched (on with ignition)
    - **Fuse Rating:** 15A (per manual specifications)
    - **Combined Circuit:** Body RTMR F2 (20A fuse, SWITCHED power with constant power tap)
  - **Features:**
    - AM/FM radio with RDS
    - Bluetooth audio streaming and hands-free calling
    - Multi-zone audio (3 zones + subwoofer)
    - DSP (Digital Signal Processing) with presets
    - NMEA 2000 integration (future expansion for GPS/depth/wind data)
    - PartyBus networking (link multiple Fusion units)
    - IPX7 waterproof rating (marine-grade for off-road dust/water resistance)
    - USB audio playback
  - **RCA Pre-Outs (to Fusion Apollo amplifier):**
    - Zone 1: Left + Right RCA outputs (to amplifier channels 3 & 4 for front dash speakers)
    - Zone 2: Left + Right RCA outputs (to amplifier channels 5 & 6 for rear roll bar speakers)
    - Zone 3: Left + Right RCA outputs (available for future expansion)
    - Subwoofer: Mono RCA output (to amplifier channels 1+2 bridged for subwoofer)
  - **Speaker Outputs:** 4x 50W RMS (not used - amplifier powers all speakers)
  - **Antenna:** Factory Jeep AM/FM antenna (mounted on fender or windshield)
    - Motorola connector (standard automotive antenna)
  - **Display:** 2.7" full-color TFT display with sunlight viewability
  - **Load:** 15A maximum (per manual specifications)

**Wiring:**
1. **Constant Power (Yellow wire):** CONSTANT bus → Body RTMR F2 (20A) → MS-RA670 constant power (memory)
   - Note: F2 will need to source from CONSTANT bus (not SWITCHED bus) to provide both constant and switched power
   - Alternative: Run separate constant power wire from CONSTANT bus to radio, keep F2 on SWITCHED bus
2. **Switched Power (Red wire):** SWITCHED bus → Body RTMR F2 (20A) → MS-RA670 switched power (ignition)
   - Radio powers on/off with ignition
3. **Ground (Black wire):** MS-RA670 ground → firewall ground stud or dash ground point
   - Clean ground critical for audio quality and noise reduction
4. **Speaker Wiring:** MS-RA670 speaker outputs → front/rear speakers via factory harness (where possible)
   - Front Left: White (+) / White-Black (-)
   - Front Right: Gray (+) / Gray-Black (-)
   - Rear Left: Green (+) / Green-Black (-)
   - Rear Right: Purple (+) / Purple-Black (-)
5. **Antenna:** MS-RA670 antenna input (blue Motorola connector) → factory antenna cable
6. **Bluetooth Microphone:** MS-RA670 microphone input → wired microphone mounted near driver (for hands-free calling)

**Power Source Clarification:**
Since the MS-RA670 requires both constant power (memory/clock) and switched power (on/off), Body RTMR F2 needs to be configured to provide both:

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Modify F2 to support dual power
- F2 constant power input from CONSTANT bus → MS-RA670 yellow wire (memory)
- F2 switched power input from SWITCHED bus → MS-RA670 red wire (ignition on/off)
- Single 20A fuse protects both circuits (15A radio draw is within capacity)

**Option 2:** Separate circuits
- F2 (SWITCHED bus, 20A) → MS-RA670 red wire only (ignition power)
- New spare Body RTMR circuit (CONSTANT bus, 15A) → MS-RA670 yellow wire only (memory)

**Outstanding Items:**
- [ ] Decide on power wiring configuration (Option 1: dual power via F2, or Option 2: separate circuits)
- [ ] Verify if Body RTMR F2 can support both CONSTANT and SWITCHED power inputs (or if separate circuit needed)
- [ ] Determine ground connection point for MS-RA670 (firewall stud or dash ground)
- [ ] Plan wiring for Bluetooth microphone mounting location (near driver for hands-free calling)
- [ ] Determine if NMEA 2000 integration will be used (future GPS/depth/wind data display on radio)
- [ ] Configure MS-RA670 DSP settings for subwoofer crossover (typically 80-120 Hz low-pass filter)
- [ ] Verify MS-RA670 Zone 1/2/3 RCA output configuration in settings (assign zones to front/rear/sub)

**Wiring Summary:**
1. **Amplifier Power (+):** CONSTANT bus → 40A or 50A Blue Sea breaker → 6 AWG red wire → amplifier B+ terminal
   - Direct connection to CONSTANT bus (rear battery) for high current
   - Run dedicated 6 AWG wire from rear battery or CONSTANT bus bar to amplifier (1800W requires heavier gauge)
   - Replace amplifier's included 40A inline fuse with centrally-located Blue Sea breaker for easier access
2. **Amplifier Ground (-):** Amplifier ground terminal → 6 AWG black wire → chassis ground or rear battery negative
   - Clean, solid ground critical for amplifier performance and noise reduction
   - Keep ground wire <18 inches for best performance
3. **MLC-RW LED Controller Power (+):** CONSTANT bus → Body RTMR spare circuit (30A) → MLC-RW power input
   - MLC-RW rated for 30A output (400W), requires 30A fuse/breaker for full capacity

**Circuit Protection:**
- **Fuse:** 40A fast-acting fuse (per Fusion Apollo manual specifications)
  - Amplifier includes inline fuse holder with 40A fuse
  - **Recommendation:** Replace inline fuse with centrally-located Blue Sea circuit breaker
- **Recommended:** Blue Sea 40A or 50A breaker at CONSTANT bus or rear battery location
  - Easier reset than inline fuse (no need to access amplifier)
  - Mount breaker at CONSTANT bus or rear battery for easy access
  - Protects full power wire run from battery to amplifier
  - Blue Sea 7178 (40A) or 7184 (50A) thermal circuit breaker recommended

**Mounting Location Options:**
