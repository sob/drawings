# 1.1.5 Wire Distance Reference {#wire-distance-reference}

Measured wire routing distances between major electrical components for voltage drop calculations and wire sizing.

!!! note "Measurement Method"
These distances represent actual measured cable routing paths (not straight-line distances) following frame rails, firewall passages, and avoiding obstacles. All measurements are one-way cable length.

!!! info "Dual Wheel Well Battery Configuration"
Both batteries located in rear wheel wells for optimal wire routing:

    - **Driver Wheel Well** = START battery (critical systems)
    - **Passenger Wheel Well** = AUX battery (accessories)
