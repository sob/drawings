# 1.4.4 PMU Programming {#pmu-programming}

PMU configuration examples, logic sequences, and implementation checklist.

## Programming Examples

### DRL Auto-Off Logic (Output 14)

```text
IF (Pin7_IgnitionRUN == ON) AND (In7_CT4_Headlights == OFF)
  THEN Out14_DRL = ON
ELSE Out14_DRL = OFF
```

DRL on with ignition, off when headlights active.

**Note:** Pin 7 is the dedicated 12V switched input (physical pin), different from In 7 which is a digital input channel. See [PMU Inputs][pmu-inputs] for complete pin assignments.

### A/C Clutch Logic (Output 17)

```text
IF (In9_AC_Request == ON) AND (BatteryVoltage > 11.5V)
  THEN Out17_AC_Clutch = ON
ELSE Out17_AC_Clutch = OFF
```

A/C engages when requested and voltage adequate.

### Oil Cooler Fan Control (Output 7) - CAN-based

```text
IF (J1939_SPN175_OilTemp > 230°F) THEN Out7_OilFan = ON
ELSEIF (J1939_SPN175_OilTemp < 220°F) THEN Out7_OilFan = OFF
```

10°F hysteresis prevents rapid cycling. Uses J1939 engine oil temperature from ECM (SPN 175).

### PS Cooler Fan Control (Output 8) - CAN-based

```text
IF (J1939_SPN110_CoolantTemp > 220°F) THEN Out8_PSFan = ON
ELSEIF (J1939_SPN110_CoolantTemp < 210°F) THEN Out8_PSFan = OFF
```

10°F hysteresis prevents rapid cycling. Uses J1939 coolant temperature from ECM (SPN 110) as proxy for PS fluid temp.

### Radiator Fan PWM Control (Output 2+3+4) - Variable Speed

```text
// Temperature-based PWM curve for variable speed control
IF (J1939_SPN110_CoolantTemp < 185°F) THEN Out234_RadiatorFan_PWM = 0%      // Fan OFF
ELSEIF (J1939_SPN110_CoolantTemp < 195°F) THEN Out234_RadiatorFan_PWM = 30%  // Low speed
ELSEIF (J1939_SPN110_CoolantTemp < 205°F) THEN Out234_RadiatorFan_PWM = 60%  // Medium speed
ELSEIF (J1939_SPN110_CoolantTemp >= 205°F) THEN Out234_RadiatorFan_PWM = 100% // Full speed
```

**Benefits:**

- **Variable speed:** 30% = ~16A, 60% = ~32A, 100% = 53A - reduces average electrical load
- **PWM frequency:** 100-400 Hz (PMU supports 4-400 Hz on 25A outputs)
- **Temperature source:** J1939 SPN 110 (coolant temp) - same as PS fan
- **Quieter operation:** Low speed sufficient for highway cruising
- **Thermal management:** Progressive cooling matches engine demand

**Replaces:** Dakota Digital PAC-2800BT controller, BIM-01-2 adapter (for fan), external relay, 100A circuit breaker

### Sequential Load Startup

```text
DELAY Out3_HVAC = 0.5s
DELAY Out7_OilFan = 1.0s
DELAY Out8_PSFan = 1.5s
```

Prevents voltage sag during ignition-on by staggering high-current load activation.

### Battery Load Monitoring

**Purpose:** Monitor battery voltage and current to track actual system load and verify alternator capacity.

**Data Logging Configuration:**

```text
LOG BatteryVoltage (continuous, 1 Hz)
LOG TotalCurrent_PMU (continuous, 1 Hz)
LOG AlternatorVoltage (if available)
LOG EngineRPM (J1939_SPN190)
```

**Critical Voltage Thresholds:**

- **14.2-14.4V** (engine running): Alternator charging normally
- **13.8-14.1V** (engine running, high load): Alternator near capacity
- **12.6-12.8V** (engine off): Fully charged battery at rest
- **<12.5V** (engine running): Alternator undersized or failing
- **<11.5V** (engine running): Critical - load exceeds alternator output

**Monitoring Strategy:**

1. **Baseline Testing:** Run engine at idle with all loads off - note voltage (should be 14.2-14.4V)
2. **Progressive Load Testing:** Add loads incrementally (HVAC → fans → lights) and monitor voltage drop
3. **Peak Load Testing:** Run all typical simultaneous loads and verify voltage stays >13.5V
4. **Data Analysis:** Export PMU logs to identify which load combinations cause voltage sag

**Warning Triggers:**

```text
IF (BatteryVoltage < 12.5V) AND (EngineRPM > 1000)
  THEN Trigger_Low_Voltage_Warning = ON
```

**Use Cases:**

- Verify 270A alternator capacity under real-world loads
- Identify which load combinations exceed alternator output
- Monitor battery state of charge during off-grid camping
- Track battery health over time (voltage recovery patterns)

### ARB Compressor Load Shedding

**Purpose:** Automatically shed non-critical loads when ARB compressor runs (90A) to prevent exceeding 270A alternator capacity.

**Summary:** Detects ARB activation and disables DRL (8A), A/C (5A), and conditionally oil/PS cooler fans (15A each) to reduce total load from 271A to 243A, providing +27A alternator margin during tire inflation.

**See:** [ARB Load Shedding Logic][arb-load-shedding] for complete implementation details, load analysis, testing procedures, and operator guidelines.
