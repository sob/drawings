## Navigation Scenarios

**"Where does [component] ground?"** → Check appropriate ground file or battery distribution

**"What grounds directly to battery negative?"** → See battery distribution pages (1.2, 1.3)

**"What connects to engine bay ground bus?"** → `01-engine-bay-ground-bus.md`

**"Where are the ground buses located?"** → `index.md` overview

## When Updating

**Adding component with direct battery ground:**

1. Update battery distribution page (1.2 or 1.3)

**Adding component to ground bus:**

1. Update appropriate bus file (01, 02, or 03)
2. Verify bus bar stud availability

**Moving ground connection:**

1. Update old ground location file
2. Update new ground location file
3. Update component's primary documentation
