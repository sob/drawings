**Assessment:** Excellent - 50A BCDC fully covers all night highway loads with margin to spare

---

### Scenario 3: Night Offroad (Full Lighting)

**Conditions:** Technical trail at night, all forward lighting, rock lights, lockers engaged

| Circuit                        |    Load | Reason             |
| :----------------------------- | ------: | :----------------- |
| **Roof Lights (OUTPUT-1)**     | **18A** | Primary forward    |

**BCDC Charging:** 50A (full rate)

**Net Battery Effect:** +5A (battery charging!)

**Assessment:** Excellent - with corrected XL Sport specs (2.2A/pod), full night offroad lighting is now fully covered by BCDC charging. Battery maintains charge even with all lights on.

### Scenario 4: Airing Up Tires (ARB Compressor)

**Conditions:** Parked after trail, engine idling, airing up 4 tires (5-10 minutes)

| Circuit                             |     Load | Reason         |
| :---------------------------------- | -------: | :------------- |
| **ARB Compressor Motor 1 (MIDI-1)** |  **45A** | Running        |
| **ARB Compressor Motor 2 (MIDI-2)** |  **45A** | Running        |
| **Compressor Control (OUTPUT-11)**  |  **15A** | Control signal |

| **USB Charging (CB48)**             |   **2A** | Phone          |
| **WolfBox Camera (CB39)**           |   **2A** | Recording      |
| **TOTAL**                           | **110A** |                |

**BCDC Charging:** 50A (full rate)

**Net Battery Effect:** -60A (moderate discharge)

**5-minute air-up:** 60A × (5/60)h = **5Ah used** (5% of usable capacity)

**10-minute air-up:** 60A × (10/60)h = **10Ah used** (9% of usable capacity)

**Assessment:** Excellent - minimal battery impact. Full recovery in 10-20 minutes of driving.

---

### Scenario 5: Extended Airing Up (30+ minutes)

**Conditions:** Airing up 5 tires + air tank refill, extended compressor operation

| Circuit                             |     Load | Reason         |
| :---------------------------------- | -------: | :------------- |
| **ARB Compressor Motor 1 (MIDI-1)** |  **45A** | Running        |
| **ARB Compressor Motor 2 (MIDI-2)** |  **45A** | Running        |
| **Compressor Control (OUTPUT-11)**  |  **15A** | Control signal |
| **Fusion Radio memory (CB30)**      |   **1A** | Always on      |
| **USB Charging (CB48)**             |   **2A** | Phone          |
| **WolfBox Camera (CB39)**           |   **2A** | Recording      |
| **TOTAL**                           | **110A** |                |

**BCDC Charging:** 50A (full rate)

**Net Battery Effect:** -60A (moderate discharge)

**30-minute operation:** 60A × 0.5h = **30Ah used** (28% of usable capacity)

**Time to 20% SOC:** 108Ah / 60A = **108 minutes** of continuous compressor operation

**Assessment:** Extended air-up no longer a concern. Can run compressor for nearly 2 hours before reaching 20% SOC.

### Scenario 6: Winch Recovery (Brief High-Current)

**Conditions:** Vehicle recovery, 30-second winch pull at moderate load

| Circuit                        |     Load | Reason         |
| :----------------------------- | -------: | :------------- |
| **Winch Motor**                | **250A** | Moderate pull  |
| **Winch Trigger (ATC-1)**      |  **10A** | Contactor coil |
| **Winch Control (CB43)**       |   **2A** | Dash rocker    |
| **Fusion Radio memory (CB30)** |   **1A** | Always on      |
| **WolfBox Camera (CB39)**      |   **2A** | Recording      |
| **TOTAL**                      | **265A** |                |

**BCDC Charging:** 50A (full rate)

**Net Battery Effect:** -215A (heavy discharge)

**30-second pull:** 215A × (30/3600)h = **1.8Ah used** (1.7% of usable capacity)

**Assessment:** Winch operations have negligible battery impact. Can perform 50+ pulls before approaching 20% SOC.

---

### Scenario 7: Camp Mode (Engine Off)

**Conditions:** Parked at camp, engine off, minimal lighting, music

| Circuit                        |    Load | Reason           |
| :----------------------------- | ------: | :--------------- |
| **Dome Lights (OUTPUT-4)**     |  **4A** | Camp lighting    |
| **Rock Lights (OUTPUT-6)**     |  **3A** | Ground lighting  |
| **Footwell Lights (MLC-RW)**   |  **1A** | Ambiance         |
| **Fusion Radio memory (CB30)** |  **1A** | Always on        |
| **Fusion Radio amp (CB44)**    |  **8A** | Music            |
| **USB Charging (CB48)**        | **10A** | Multiple devices |
| **TOTAL**                      | **27A** |                  |

**BCDC Charging:** 0A (engine off)

**Solar (daytime):** ~5-6A (80W panel)

**Net Battery Effect (day):** -21A

**Net Battery Effect (night):** -27A

**Time to 20% SOC (no solar):** 108Ah / 27A = **4 hours**

**Time to 20% SOC (with solar):** 108Ah / 21A = **5+ hours** (daytime only)

**Assessment:** Camp mode now practical. 4+ hours of music, lights, and charging without engine. For extended camping:

- Solar extends daytime runtime significantly
- Idle engine 30 min to recover ~25Ah
- Multi-day camping still benefits from periodic charging

## Summary

| Scenario          | Total Draw | BCDC | Net Effect | Time to 20% SOC | Status    |
| :---------------- | :--------- | :--- | :--------- | :-------------- | :-------- |
| Daily Driving     | 5A         | 50A  | +45A       | N/A (charging)  | Excellent |
| Night Highway     | 35A        | 50A  | +15A       | N/A (charging)  | Excellent |
| Night Offroad     | 45A        | 50A  | +5A        | N/A (charging)  | Excellent |
| Air Up (5-10 min) | 110A       | 50A  | -60A       | 108 minutes     | Excellent |
| Air Up Extended   | 110A       | 50A  | -60A       | 108 minutes     | Excellent |
| Winch Recovery    | 265A       | 50A  | -215A      | 50+ pulls       | Excellent |
| Camp Mode         | 27A        | 0A   | -27A       | **4 hours**     | Good      |

**Key Insight:** With corrected XL Sport specs (2.2A/pod vs 6A), full night offroad lighting (45A) is now fully covered by 50A BCDC charging. The Dakota Lithium 135Ah upgrade provides effectively unlimited runtime for all driving scenarios including full lighting. Camp mode provides 4+ hours without engine.
