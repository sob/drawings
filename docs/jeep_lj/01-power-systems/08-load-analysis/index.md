# 1.8 Load Analysis {#load-analysis}

Scenario-based load analysis for the dual battery electrical system.

## System Architecture

The Jeep LJ uses a dual battery architecture with isolated power domains:

| Battery | Location | Charging | Primary Loads |
|:--------|:---------|:---------|:--------------|
| **START** | Driver wheel well | Alternator (270A) | PMU, engine systems, BCDC |
| **AUX** | Passenger wheel well | BCDC (50A) + Solar (6A) | SwitchPros, SafetyHub, BODY PDU |

**Key Principle:** The BCDC is the only connection between batteries during normal operation. AUX battery loads do NOT draw from the alternator directly.

## Analysis Methodology

### Realistic Scenario Approach

Load analysis uses realistic operating scenarios rather than theoretical worst-case sums:

1. **Identify which battery** powers each circuit (START vs AUX)
2. **Analyze each battery separately** with its own charging source
3. **Use realistic scenarios** (daily driving, offroad, airing up, recovery)
4. **Account for duty cycles** (brief peaks vs continuous loads)
5. **Consider mutually exclusive activities** (can't brake hard while winching)

### Why Not Sum All Loads?

**Never create "theoretical worst case" scenarios:**

- Do NOT sum all loads at peak simultaneously
- Do NOT combine mutually exclusive activities (braking + winching + radio TX)
- Do NOT add AUX battery loads to alternator calculations
- Do NOT flag alternator "undersizing" based on impossible scenarios

**Example - WRONG:**

```text
PMU max: 253A + SwitchPros max: 127A + ARB: 90A + Winch: 400A = 870A
Alternator: 270A = CRITICAL UNDERSIZING ❌
```

**Example - CORRECT:**

```text
START Battery Scenario (Offroad):
PMU typical: 115A + Radiator fan: 53A + BCDC: 50A = 218A
Alternator: 270A = 52A margin ✅

AUX Battery Scenario (Night Offroad):
SwitchPros: 70A, BCDC charging: 50A
Net drain: 20A, Time to 50% SOC: 102 minutes ✅
```

### Load Categories

| Category | Characteristic | Analysis Approach |
|:---------|:---------------|:------------------|
| **Continuous** | Always on when operating | Include in all scenarios |
| **Intermittent** | Cycles on/off | Use average or typical duty |
| **Peak** | Brief bursts (seconds) | Note duration, don't add to continuous |
| **Seasonal** | A/C, heated seats | Include in relevant scenarios only |
| **Mutually Exclusive** | Braking vs accelerating | Never combine |

## Load Exclusions

These loads are **NOT** included in running alternator calculations:

| Load | Current | Reason |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|
| Starter | 400-600A | Cranking only (engine off) |
| Grid Heater | 250A | 3-5 sec cold start only |
| Winch | 400A | AUX battery (isolated) |
| ARB Compressor | 90A | AUX battery (isolated) |
| SwitchPros lights | 100A+ | AUX battery (isolated) |

## Summary Results

### START Battery (Alternator-Supplied)

| Scenario | Total Load | Alternator | Utilization | Status |
|:---------|:-----------|:-----------|:------------|:-------|
| Highway Driving | 107A | 270A | 40% | ✅ Excellent |
| Hot City Driving | 194A | 270A | 72% | ✅ Good |
| Offroad Trail | 207A | 270A | 77% | ✅ Good |
| Emergency Braking | 166A | 270A | 61% | ✅ Excellent |
| Parked Idling | 123A | 270A | 46% | ✅ Excellent |

**Worst Case:** 207A (offroad) = 63A margin ✅

### AUX Battery (BCDC-Charged)

| Scenario | Total Draw | BCDC | Net Effect | Duration Limit | Status |
|:---------|:-----------|:-----|:-----------|:---------------|:-------|
| Daily Driving | 5A | 50A | +45A | Unlimited | ✅ Charging |
| Night Highway | 38A | 50A | +12A | Unlimited | ✅ Charging |
| Night Offroad | 70A | 50A | -20A | 102 min | ✅ Excellent |
| Air Up (5-10 min) | 110A | 50A | -60A | 10 min | ✅ Excellent |
| Air Up Extended | 110A | 50A | -60A | 34 min | ✅ Practical |
| Winch Recovery | 265A | 50A | -215A | 30-sec pulls | ✅ Brief OK |
| Camp Mode | 27A | 0A | -27A | 76 min | ⚠️ Limited |

**Key Insight:** 50A BCDC enables night highway charging and 102-minute night offroad runtime.
