- Typical: 250A continuous during recovery
- Peak: 400A brief (winch stall or heavy load)
- Duration: 10-30 seconds typical, 60 seconds maximum
- Duty Cycle: Brief intermittent use (not continuous)

**Wire Sizing:**

- Wire: 1/0 AWG copper (325A continuous rating @ 60°C)
- Distance: 13 ft one-way (26 ft total circuit)
- Voltage drop @ 250A: 5.32% (0.638V) - acceptable for brief accessory loads
- Voltage drop @ 400A: 8.51% (1.021V) - acceptable for brief peak loads

**Protection Mechanisms:**

1. **Internal Thermal Cutoff**
   - Winch motor has integrated thermal protection
   - Trips before windings reach damage temperature
   - Automatic reset when motor cools

2. **Contactor Disconnect**
   - Isolates winch when not in use
   - Prevents parasitic drain
   - Manual control provides emergency stop

3. **Cable Self-Protection**
   - 1/0 AWG fuses open at ~800A+ (thermal runaway)
   - Well above 400A operating peak
   - Adequate for brief loads per SAE J1128

4. **Manual Battery Disconnect**
   - Master disconnect at AUX battery terminal
   - Emergency shutoff capability
   - Maintenance safety

### Winch Standards Comparison

**Marine (ABYC E-11):**

## SwitchPros & SafetyHub - CB Sized for Device Capacity

**Components:** SwitchPros RCR-Force 12, Blue Sea SafetyHub 150

**Decision:** 150A circuit breakers protecting 2 AWG wire (130A @ 20°C)

**Apparent Issue:** CB rating (150A) exceeds wire continuous ampacity (130A) by 15%

### Engineering Analysis

**Why This Is Safe:**

The CB is sized for _device capacity_, not actual load. Actual loads are well within wire rating:

| Device     | Device Max | Actual Load | Wire Rating | Load % of Wire |
| :--------- | :--------- | :---------- | :---------- | :------------- |
| SwitchPros | 150A       | ~48A        | 130A        | 37%            |
| SafetyHub  | 150A       | 100A        | 130A        | 77%            |

**SwitchPros Actual Load Breakdown:**

- Roof lights: 18A (8x XL Sport @ 2.2A each)
- Auxiliary lights: 26A (ditch 8A, fog 6A, work 5A, rock 3A, dome 2A, chase 1A, rear 5A)
- Lockers: 4A
- **Total: ~48A** (32% of CB rating)

**SafetyHub Actual Load Breakdown:**

- ARB Compressor: 90A (2x 45A motors)
- Winch trigger: 10A
- **Total: 100A** (67% of CB rating)

### Protection Strategy

**Normal Operation:**

- Wire operates at 37-77% of its ampacity
- No thermal stress, adequate safety margin
- Wire temperature remains well below insulation rating

**Fault Condition (Short Circuit):**

- Fault current exceeds CB rating → CB trips
- Brief overload duration (milliseconds to seconds) insufficient to damage wire
- 2 AWG thermal mass absorbs brief fault current safely

**CB Trip Curve Analysis:**

- Mechanical Products Series 17 trips at 135% of rating within 30 seconds
- At 150A × 135% = 202A, CB trips before wire reaches damage temperature
- Short circuit currents (500A+) trip CB nearly instantaneously

### Wire Sizing Rationale

**Why 2 AWG (not 1/0 AWG):**

1. **Actual load headroom:** 82-100A loads have 30-48A margin to wire rating
2. **Consistency:** All CONSTANT bus outputs use 2 AWG for standardization
3. **Future flexibility:** 130A wire supports load growth within device capacity
4. **Cost/weight:** 1/0 AWG unnecessary for actual loads

**Why 150A CB (not 125A):**

1. **Device protection:** Matches SwitchPros and SafetyHub rated capacity
2. **Inrush tolerance:** Lighting loads have brief inrush spikes
3. **Future headroom:** Allows adding loads up to device capacity

### Standards Context

**ABYC E-11 (Marine):**

- Requires CB ≤ wire ampacity for continuous loads
- **However:** Actual loads are not continuous at full capacity
- SwitchPros lighting loads are intermittent (not 24/7 operation)
- SafetyHub ARB compressor runs only during airing up (minutes, not hours)

**SAE J1128 (Automotive):**

- Wire sizing based on actual load, not theoretical maximum
- CB sizing considers duty cycle and thermal time constants
- Brief overloads acceptable if within wire thermal limits

### Review Guidance

**This is NOT a safety issue.**

The apparent CB > wire mismatch is intentional:

1. Actual loads (82-100A) well within wire rating (130A)
2. CB sized for device capacity and inrush tolerance
3. Fault protection adequate (CB trips before wire damage)
4. Intermittent duty cycle (not continuous operation)

**Do NOT flag as requiring wire upgrade or CB downgrade.**
