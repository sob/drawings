## System Overview

Engine bay systems are powered primarily from the front battery via PMU24 programmable power distribution (see [1.4 - PMU][# 1.4 - PMU Power Distribution {#pmu-power-distribution}]). The PMU provides intelligent power management with ignition-triggered circuits, overcurrent protection, and diagnostic capabilities.

Critical safety systems (brake booster, starter) have direct battery connections for reliability.
