- **Four Outputs:**
  - SW1 (UP): Right Turn Signal (configured in turn signal mode)
  - SW2 (DOWN): Left Turn Signal (configured in turn signal mode)
  - SW3 (PULL): Headlights (low beam, latching on/off)
  - SW4 (PUSH): High Beams (momentary or toggle)
- **Built-in Hazard Switch:** Flashes all outputs in sync when pressed
- **Built-in Audio Module:** Audible sound when turn signal is active
- **Lane Change Feature:** Lever press <0.5 sec flashes turn signal 3 times

## Turn Signal and Lighting System Integration

The CT4 provides complete turn signal and headlight control:

### Turn Signals

- **Front Turn Signals:** Amber LED turn signal lights (dedicated turn signal only)
  - Wired to CT4 SW1 (right) and SW2 (left) outputs
  - Wire gauge: 14 AWG from CT4 to junction, 16 AWG to each light
  - **Note:** These are dedicated turn signals, not dual-function with parking lights

- **Rear Turn Signals:** Maxbilt Trail Tail lights (integrated brake/turn/marker/reverse)
  - **Brake/Turn wire (Yellow):** Combined brake and turn signal function
  - Wired to CT4 SW1 (right) and SW2 (left) outputs (parallel with front signals)
  - Wire gauge: 14 AWG from CT4 to rear junction
  - **Note:** Yellow wire handles both brake and turn signal (combined function)

### Headlight Control

- **Headlights (SW3 - PULL):** Baja Designs LP6 headlights (low beam)
  - **Pull lever** → Activates headlights (low beam)
  - Power: CT4 main battery power (40A CONSTANT) → internal switching → SW3 output
  - CT4 SW3 output → LP6 Pin 1 (low beam, both lights in parallel)
  - CT4 handles switching internally (10A output capacity, 3.6A actual load)
  - Disabled when ignition off (via ignition signal from ignition switch RUN)
  - Latching on/off control (pull once to turn on, pull again to turn off)
  - Wire gauge: 14 AWG from CT4 SW3 output to LP6 headlights
  - When active: Also triggers DRL cutoff relay to disable DRL circuit (SW3 output tapped to relay coil)

- **High Beams (SW4 - PUSH):** Switches to high beams
  - **Push lever** (while headlights on) → Activates high beams
  - Power: CT4 main battery power (40A CONSTANT) → internal switching → SW4 output
  - CT4 SW4 output → LP6 Pin 4 (high beam, both lights in parallel)
  - CT4 handles switching internally (10A output capacity, 5.6A actual load)
  - Disabled when ignition off (via ignition signal from ignition switch RUN)
  - CT4 provides mutual exclusivity (high beam disables low beam automatically)
  - Momentary or latching toggle (programmable)
  - Wire gauge: 14 AWG from CT4 SW4 output to LP6 headlights

### DRL/Parking Lights

Automatic ignition-controlled circuit that powers:
- License plate lights
- LP6 Headlight DRL function (Pin 3) - **via cutoff relay**
- Front 2" LED side markers (parking function)
- Maxbilt tail light RED wire (marker/parking function)

**Power Source:** PMU Out 9 (8A capacity, SWITCHED)

**DRL Auto-Off:** PMU programming logic disables when CT4 SW3 activates (headlights on = DRL off)

Wire gauge: 14 AWG from PMU to junction, 16 AWG to each light

See [PMU DRL Auto-Off Logic](#pmu-drl-auto-off-logic) section below for complete wiring.

## Wiring Pinout

**12-pin Connector on CT4:**

| Wire Color | Label      | Function                | Connection Point               | Notes                             |
| :--------- | :--------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Brown      | SW1, UP    | Right Turn (CT4 output) | Front/rear right turn signals  | 10A max per output                |
| Red        | SW2, DOWN  | Left Turn (CT4 output)  | Front/rear left turn signals   | 10A max per output                |
| Orange     | SW3, PULL  | Headlights (low beam)   | LP6 Pin 1 (low beam, both lights) + DRL cutoff relay coil | 10A output, 3.6A load, disabled when ignition off |
| Yellow     | SW4, PUSH  | High Beams              | LP6 Pin 4 (high beam, both lights) | 10A output, 5.6A load, disabled when ignition off |
| Red (thick)| 12V Supply | Main power input        | Front battery CONSTANT (40A fuse) | Powers all SW outputs, allows hazards when ignition off |
| Black      | Ground     | Ground return           | Chassis ground or firewall ground stud | Via ignition/ground harness   |
| White/Gray | Ignition   | Ignition signal input   | Ignition switch RUN output (18 AWG, splits to PMU In 6, SwitchPros, CT4) | Disables SW3/SW4 when ignition off, keeps SW1/SW2 active |

## Programming Configuration

The CT4 is highly programmable. Recommended configuration for this build:

1. **Turn Signal Mode:** GPS turn signal mode (automatic cancellation based on speed and steering angle)
   - SW1 (UP) = Right Turn
   - SW2 (DOWN) = Left Turn
   - GPS module monitors vehicle speed and steering to detect turn completion

2. **Ignition Control:** Ignition-aware mode
   - SW1/SW2 (turn signals/hazards) work anytime, even when ignition is off (critical for safety)
   - SW3/SW4 (headlights) disabled when ignition off (via ignition signal from ignition switch RUN)
   - Prevents battery drain from headlights left on

3. **ON-OFF/Momentary:**
   - SW1/SW2: ON-OFF (latching turn signals with GPS auto-cancel)
   - SW3 (Headlights): ON-OFF latching (pull to turn on/off)
   - SW4 (High Beams): Momentary or ON-OFF (choose preferred behavior)

4. **Low Voltage Disconnect:** Enabled for all switches (protects battery from over-discharge)

5. **Flash/Strobe:** Disabled (turn signals use built-in flash pattern)

6. **Switch Memory:** Disabled (turn signals don't remember state after ignition cycle)

## GPS Module Configuration

The CT4 includes a GPS module that enables intelligent automatic turn signal cancellation:

- **GPS Auto-Cancel:** Monitors vehicle speed and steering angle to detect when a turn is complete
- **Manual Override:** Can still manually cancel by moving lever to center or opposite direction
- **Lane Change Mode:** Quick press (<0.5 sec) still flashes 3 times, then auto-cancels
- **Mounting:** GPS antenna must have clear view of sky (mount on dash or near windshield)
- **Calibration:** May require initial calibration drive for optimal performance

### PMU DRL Auto-Off Logic

**Purpose:** Automatically turns off DRL when headlights are activated via CT4 SW3

**Implementation:** PMU programming logic (no external relay needed)

**PMU Configuration:**

```
PMU Input 7 (In 7): CT4 SW3 headlight status signal (tapped from low beam circuit)
PMU Input 6 (In 6): Ignition RUN signal
PMU Output 9 (Out 9): DRL/Parking lights circuit

Programming Logic:
IF (In6_IgnitionRUN == ON) AND (In7_CT4_Headlights == OFF)
  THEN Out9_DRL = ON
ELSE
  Out9_DRL = OFF
END
```

**How It Works:**

1. **Ignition ON, Headlights OFF (CT4 SW3 off):**
   - PMU In 6 = ON (ignition RUN)
   - PMU In 7 = OFF (CT4 SW3 not active)
   - PMU Out 9 = ON
   - All DRL/parking lights illuminated

2. **Ignition ON, Headlights ON (CT4 SW3 on):**
   - PMU In 6 = ON (ignition RUN)
   - PMU In 7 = ON (CT4 SW3 active)
   - PMU Out 9 = OFF
   - Headlights (low or high beam) active instead

3. **Ignition OFF:**
   - PMU In 6 = OFF
   - PMU Out 9 = OFF (regardless of headlight status)
   - All DRL/parking lights off

**Installation Notes:**

- Tap CT4 SW3 output (low beam circuit) to PMU In 7 for headlight status monitoring
- Use 14 AWG wire from PMU Out 9 to DRL junction
- PMU Out 9 distributes to:
  - LP6 Pin 3 (DRL) - both lights
  - License plate lights
  - Front LED side markers
  - Maxbilt tail RED wire (marker/parking)
- Total DRL circuit load: ~8A (4 circuits: license plate, LP6 DRL, front markers, rear markers)
- PMU Out 9 capacity: 15A (sufficient for 8A load)

**Advantages over relay:**
- No external relay hardware required
- PMU monitors current draw and provides diagnostics
- Programmable delays and soft-start capabilities
- Can log DRL activation events
- Integrated overcurrent protection
