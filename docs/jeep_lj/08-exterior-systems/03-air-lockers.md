## Wiring

### Solenoid Control

| Locker | SwitchPros Output | Wire   | Route                                               |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Front  | OUTPUT-17         | 18 AWG | Wheel well → driver frame rail → front axle (~12 ft) |
| Rear   | OUTPUT-10         | 18 AWG | Wheel well → rear axle (~6 ft)                      |

### Wire Routing

- **Front Locker (OUTPUT-17):** SwitchPros (wheel well) → along driver frame rail → to front axle solenoid (~12 ft)
  - Wire: 18 AWG (2A load, low-side driver output)
  - Protection: Split loom, P-clamps every 18", secure to frame rail
- **Rear Locker (OUTPUT-10):** SwitchPros (wheel well) → to rear axle solenoid (~6 ft)
  - Wire: 18 AWG (2A load)
  - Protection: Split loom where exposed, secure to axle housing

## Air Line Routing

!!! info "Air Line Installation"
    Air lines from manifold must be routed to both axles with proper protection from heat, abrasion, and road debris.

| Line         | Route                                                          | Length |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Front Locker | Manifold (under seat) → along driver frame rail → front axle   | ~12 ft |
| Rear Locker  | Manifold (under seat) → to rear axle                           | ~6 ft  |

**Air Line Specifications:**

- **Type:** ARB air line kit (1/4" OD nylon tubing, 200 PSI rated)
- **Fittings:** Push-to-connect fittings at manifold and locker ends

**Protection:**

- Split loom over entire run where exposed to road debris
- P-clamps every 12" along frame rail
- High-temp silicone sleeve where crossing near exhaust (6" minimum clearance)
- Rubber grommets at body/frame penetrations

## Operation

### Engagement Sequence

**Front Locker:**

1. Press Button 9 (OUTPUT-17)
2. Solenoid opens, pressurized air from tank → front locker
3. Front differential locks **instantly** (no waiting for compressor)
4. Release Button 9 to disengage

**Rear Locker:**

1. Press Button 10 (OUTPUT-10)
2. Solenoid opens, pressurized air from tank → rear locker
3. Rear differential locks **instantly**
4. Release Button 10 to disengage

**Automatic Refill:**

- After multiple locker uses, tank pressure drops below 135 PSI
- Pressure switch automatically activates compressor to refill tank
- No user action required

## Safety Considerations

!!! warning "Locker Operation"
    - Only engage lockers at low speeds (typically <5 mph)
    - Disengage lockers before returning to normal speeds
    - Never engage lockers on dry pavement
    - Ensure adequate air pressure before engaging lockers

## Outstanding Items

- [ ] Verify ARB RD116 compatibility with Dana 44 30-spline 5.38 gear ratio
- [ ] Order ARB air line installation kit with 1/4" fittings for front/rear lockers
